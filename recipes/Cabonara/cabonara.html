    <h1>About Cabonara</h1>
    <p>Pasta carbonara is an indulgent yet surprisingly simple recipe. Made with pancetta (or bacon) and plenty of Parmesan, this recipe takes only 30 minutes to prepare from start to finish!</p>
    

    <h2>List of ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta noodles of your choice</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 egg yolk + 1 egg white</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to take</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)</li>
        <li>While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large saut√© pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)</li>

    </ol>
